    "# **Introduction: The forger versus the police**\n",
    "Note: read the story even if you are already familiar with GANs, as one of the questions is related to this story.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generative models try to model the distribution of the data in an explicit way, in the sense that we can easily sample new data points from this model. This is in contrast to discriminative models that try to infer the output from the input. In class and in the previous problem, we have seen one classic deep generative model, the Variational Autoencoder (VAE). Here, we will learn another generative model that has risen to prominence in recent years, the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN).\n",
    "\n",
    "As the math of Generative Adversarial Networks are somewhat tedious, a story is often told of a forger and a police officer to illustrate the idea.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> Imagine a forger that makes fake bills, and a police officer that tries to find these forgeries. If the forger were a VAE, his goal would be to take some real bills, and try to replicate the real bills as precisely as possible. With GANs, the forger has a different idea: rather than trying to replicate the real bills, it suffices to make fake bills such that people think they are real.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Now let's start. In the beginning, the police knows nothing about how to distinguish between real and fake bills. The forger knows nothing either and only produces white paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "> In the first round, the police gets the fake bill and learns that the forgeries are white while the real bills are green. The forger then finds out that white papers can no longer fool the police and starts to produce green papers.\n",
    "\n",
    "> In the second round, the police learns that real bills have denominations printed on them while the forgeries do not. The forger then finds out that plain papers can no longer fool the police and starts to print numbers on them.\n",
    "\n",
    "> In the third round, the police learns that real bills have watermarks on them while the forgeries do not. The forger then has to reproduce the watermarks on his fake bills.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ...\n",
    "\n",
    "> Finally, the police is able to spot the tiniest difference between real and fake bills and the forger has to make perfect replicas of real bills to fool the police.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now in a GAN, the forger becomes the generator and the police becomes the discriminator. The discriminator is a binary classifier with the two classes being \"taken from the real data\" (\"real\") and \"generated by the generator\" (\"fake\"). Its objective is to minimize the classification loss. The generator's objective is to generate samples so that the discriminator misclassifies them as real.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we have some complications: the goal is not to find one perfect fake sample. Such a sample will not actually fool the discriminator: if the forger makes hundreds of the exact same fake bill, they will all have the same serial number and the police will soon find out that they are fake. Instead, we want the generator to be able to generate a variety of fake samples such that when presented as a distribution alongside the distribution of real samples, these two are indistinguishable by the discriminator.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how do we generate different samples with a deterministic generator? We provide it with random numbers as input.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, for the discriminator we use binary cross entropy loss with label 1 being real and 0 being fake. For the generator, the input is a random vector drawn from a standard normal distribution. Denote the generator by $G_\\phi(z)$, discriminator by $D_\\theta (x)$, the distribution of the real samples by $p(x)$ and the input distribution to the generator by $q(z)$. Recall that the binary cross entropy loss with classifier output $y$ and label $\\hat{y}$ is \n",
    "\n",
    "$$L(y, \\hat{y}) = -\\hat{y} \\log y - (1 - \\hat{y}) \\log (1 - y)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For the discriminator, the objective is \n",
    "$$\\min_{\\theta} \\mathrm{E}_{x \\sim p(x)}[L(D_{\\theta}(x), 1)] + \\mathrm{E}_{z \\sim q(z)}[L(D_{\\theta}(G_{\\phi}(z)), 0)]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For the generator, the objective is \n",
    "$$\\max_{\\phi} \\mathrm{E}_{z \\sim q(z)}[L(D_{\\theta}(G_{\\phi}(z)), 0)]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The generator's objective corresponds to maximizing the classification loss of the discriminator on the generated samples. Alternatively, we can **minimize** the classification loss of the discriminator on the generated samples **when labelled as real:**\n",
    "$$\\min_{\\phi} \\mathrm{E}_{z \\sim q(z)}[L(D_{\\theta}(G_{\\phi}(z)), 1)]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "And this is what we will use in our implementation. The strength of the two networks should be balanced, so we train the two networks alternatingly, updating th eparameters in both networks once in each iteration."
